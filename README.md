# Film Image Classification Project

This project explores the fascinating intersection of colour usage in film and machine learning. It focuses on two distinct films, “Oppenheimer” and “Barbie”, investigating them through visualisations and colour palette extraction. The study further extends to the application of machine learning models, specifically K-Nearest Neighbours (KNN) and Random Forest Classifiers (RFC), to classify images based on their film origin. The performance of these models is evaluated using two types of inputs - the extracted colour palettes and the raw image data.

## Results

The highest accuracy (0.86) was achieved by the RFC model utilising the raw image data. While extracting colour palettes can be useful for visualising the colour design of the films, they provide little additional benefit when used as input features for film classification.

## Future Work

Future work could explore other feature extraction techniques and machine learning models, as well as ways to optimise model performance through hyperparameter tuning and other strategies.
